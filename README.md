SMART REAL-TIME TRACKING AND PLANNING SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES

**MAIN OBJECTIVE**

The proposed system aims to provide users with reliable and accurate real time data like bus or train’s live location and an advanced route planner to increase the efficiency and timeliness when travel using public transportation methods. 

**RESEARCH QUESTION**

The demand for the public transportation is influenced by factors such as quality of service, fares, travel time, and especially the waiting time and the reliability of service but in most of the cases, unpredictable traffic conditions and temporary closed down roads and under repairing roads may divert traffic to other alternative roads resulting a delay and moreover, certain routes schedule buses in morning and evening to target the office crowd.  therefore, not knowing the correct schedules and unpredictable delaying of transportation services may lead serious issues to the commuters such as long delays and longer waiting time at transit places and public transportation service reliability is a typical issue in developing nations' cities. There are various elements to consider when it comes to reliability. The most basic question is whether a service exists at all, and if so, whether it works on a timetable, assuming one exists. The vehicle's own reliability is also important: frequent mechanical failure will subtract significantly from service reliability. In certain cities, buses regularly fail to complete their routes, especially when there are just a few people on board. Therefore in the old system if a person wishes to travel using public transportation, the person must first go to the station and inquire about the train or bus is information from the station manager or timekeepers as the telephone connections are not always up to date and reliable and most of the time due to unforeseen circumstances, if the train or the bus is delayed, commuters are required to remain until the train or the bus returns. People are losing their valuable time and some even have to postpone their scheduled work because of this matter.
The Sri Lankan government concentrates solely on highway development in the transportation sector, but effective monitoring is also required to ensure long-term sustainability. The timekeepers stationed at the main bus stations in major cities monitor and record bus movements. These timekeepers keep track of when buses arrive and depart from the Stand. However, many communities lack bus stops and instead rely on passenger halts/shelters. The remainder of the long route was not properly monitored. Because of human mistakes, the manual technique may result in incorrect recording; also, this paper-based system is often useless. These records are also no longer useful to travelers. 
We have conducted a survey (Result is annexed in the Appendix A) of using public transportation means and issues when traveling using above means and we have discovered that a significant percentage of users of all age groups are using public transportation in both bus and train as a regular method of transportation but 98% of the survey volunteers aren't satisfied with current system as the waiting time and cancellations due to unpredicted delays and poorly organized timetables and they are more likely to use an application similar to which is proposed by us. Even though there are real time tracking systems and road assistants available, in our proposed system we provide commuter an advanced route planning system unlike other systems which don't have all the elements altogether to provide more accurate data.

Some designers and developers may cram the app with needless features that, in their perspective, would boost the app's attractiveness. When the design isn't unique, though, it has the opposite impact. Overloaded design solutions bore consumers and lead them to exit the program. Many businesses aim to reach out to a large number of people. What works for ten-year-old, however, may not work for fourteen-year-olds and as well as elderly people. This is why it's crucial to examine graphic needs, language utilized, intricacy, and so on. These features should be tuned to appeal to all groups of the target market [9]. When considering a navigation app and also a route planning application, the application must be not complicated but it also needs to do the task correctly.

Security and privacy are regarded one of the key impediments to the broad expansion and adoption of IoT. The public is not confident that IoT would not compromise user privacy. The IoT security algorithm must address a number of challenges, including safeguarding user privacy, spending less energy in the process, and offering good protection against assaults.
MQTT was not intended with security in mind; instead, it has been utilized in secure, back-end networks for application-specific goals in the past. Other drawbacks of MQTT include its lack of compatibility and the protocol's lack of authentication mechanisms. Clients can transmit a username and password with the CONNECT packet to authenticate with the MQTT Broker. Authentication is available as an option in MQTT. Even when authentication is utilized, encryption is not employed by default, therefore credentials are provided in plain text. MITM attacks may still be used to acquire a user's credentials and location information.

Public transportation is significant for saving time. There is sort of profits of managing a proper transportation system for public people. Major thing is to optimize traffic and reduce fatality rate and environment pollution as well. Some people use to travel by their own vehicles daily due to poor public transportation if the quality can be maintained with a Propper standard statements it is possible to make them use public transportation 
There is sort of problems regarding Sri Lankan transportation system. Most common problems can be presented as given below according to a survey performed by us.
According to the survey waiting for a bus or train is a higher issue and people spend too much time in bus halts and train stations and they are not satisfied with this issue. Affecting on their working efficient makes an extra distress in their mind and is not pleasant enough to do their duty well.
The next issue which is coming across the poor transportation system is incorrect timetables. Although timetables are published buses or trains do not work on time or sometimes timetables are not updated according to changes and not coordinated properly. Though there are bus keepers they do not have a proper idea about some absent buses. Therefore, people have to bother about their routes, and they have to inquire for another route instead of usual.
Research plan has been modeled to provide solutions for transportation problems with helping of advanced intelligent route plan which is not implemented in the transportation app. Single integrated app for both buses and trains could be invented which helps people much to manage their best route revolving time duration, distance, and turnings. Including both into single app has a lot of advantages. Sri Lankan major two transportation modes are involved simultaneously for the process in this app. No need to switch into another app for a single task. Each can be done with higher efficient.

In several studies, it can only be observed indicating the right direction of the vehicle's travel. However, we feel that this method is insufficient for this public transit system. This is because there is a greater risk for users in our system to display the present position of an irrelevant vehicle that is traveling for a purpose unrelated to their route. Case is tracking device is turned on and it is unable to detect the relevant path, to prevent the vehicle from being displayed on the map, the tracking device must be turned off (normal procedure). The adoption of such procedures may cast doubt on the reliability of the entire system. Because if the driver fails to conduct this function or fails to restart the disabled device. A particular technique is required to reduce such faults and preserve the overall system's high reliability. This is addressed in some detail in the first literature review using RFID [4]. But due to the high cost and difficulty of maintaining such a system, it is not practical. This suggested approach has ability to determine that the vehicle is driving on the appropriate route without the assistance of any hardware device or the driver’s involvement, and that it has arrived at the main stops with the help of geo-fencing.

Public transport services such as train/bus main public transportation methods in Sri Lanka. According to the Daily Mirror of 12th October 2015, over 500,000 vehicles enter Colombo every day, carrying over 1.8 million people. Out of around 500,000 vehicles, 87% (443,000) of the vehicles are private vehicles that carry about 44% of the total passengers while the majority of the passengers (51%) use public transport to reach Colombo [9]. Bus arrival time prediction more accurately and transits by transits is the main focus of the prediction.
The main research question is,
How to predict a more accurate arrival time?  
According to the main research problem, GPRS sensors, Input parameters get using GPS Module data and then machine learning algorithms to predict arrival time so, require more other inputs to accomplish that objective.

  Parameters
▪️ Weekend and Special Days
▪️ Red signal Duration 
▪️ Driver Mode
▪️ Weather conditions and Accidents
▪️ Waiting Time
▪️ Distance
▪️ Road Condition 
▪️ Traffic
Sub Research Questions: -
    How to get input parameters?
    How to predict arrival time using machine learning algorithms?
To achieve more accurate time prediction, need to consider all the necessary parameters. Collect all the parameters details by GPS trackers and other sources like google reports. Also need historical data of all the parameters. Calculating accurate time prediction needs more accurate input details. Providing all the parameter details and historical data can train the Artificial intelligent algorithms, after testing the input and testing the improvement of the results.

Enhance and encrypt the publish payload. An encryption technique must be created in order to solve this problem. At the application layer, Payload Encryption offers security. Payload Encryption is used when a programmer does not want to communicate data in plain text but does not want to employ TLS security. This adds an extra degree of security because all application data is safeguarded and encrypted this manner as well. Instead of complete transport level encryption, payload encryption encrypts the actual application data. The payload or message is still encrypted in this manner, even while the topic is unencrypted.

Major purpose is to incorporate a sophisticate intelligence-based advanced route planning system which is designed by optimizing existing algorithms with integration of both bus and train paths which is not found out with other systems.Once the best route is found, whole fee for the routing also is calculated simultaneously for a better service. This is one of the most significant factors of this app. It’s pretty much easy to distinguish this app with others because this suggests a well optimized rout even with fee. Alternative paths are programmed to be shown distinctly with respect to minimum fee, shortest distance and number of interchanges.

Creating an automatic vehicle location system that uses GPS for positioning information and GSM/GPRS for data transfer that has the following features:
After a defined time, interval the vehicle's position information (latitude and longitude) is acquired.
Transmission of the vehicle's position and other data (ignition status, speed) to the monitoring station/Tracking server after a predetermined period of time.
clever enough to detect whether a vehicle is traveling on a given route based on the difficulties discussed. Similarly, if a vehicle is moving on a road that is unrelated to it, the system may detect it and suspend showing it on the map by using road geo-fencing technology. The goal of this application's development is to get it implemented on the public transportation system.
